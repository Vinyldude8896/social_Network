# social_Network

### This project is a build for the back end for a social network startup. 

### this project will include a MongoDB Database with Mongoose ODM and will also use Express.js for routing. Please see walkthrough video for insomnia route demo.
### Future development - I would like to be able to tie this to a front end app and have the full package working and deployed.
