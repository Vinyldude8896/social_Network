# social_Network

### User Story
A a social network company starting up. I need someone to build a reliable back end for the front end application we have available. This back end should iunclude a MongoDB database and use Mongoose ODM. Also needed are the router and routes for the site. As a company we need to have a well built back end with a video demo of working routes and create, read, update and delete data operations.

### Features
This app features a back end build for a social newtwork company.
This app features a back ende server built using express.js.
This app features routes and controllers for CRUD(create, Read, Update, Delete) to the MongoDB database.
This app features a video walkthrough displaying the functionality of all the CRUD routes for each model.
### Future development - I would like to be able to tie this to a front end app and have the full package working and deployed.
